Github Restrictions Hider
===
Nothing special here. This WebExtension just removes annoying yellow message that says we (countries that are under sanctions by US laws) are restricted to use Github.   
We were a little excited to hear that Microsoft let's us create private repositories, but now our private repositories are disabled and we don't have even read access to them!!    

As a single person, all i can do now is to ignore your message, just like you ignored the freedom of open source.
